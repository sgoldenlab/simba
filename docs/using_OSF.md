# Downloading data (models, videos, annotations etc.) from the [SimBA OSF repository](https://osf.io/tmu6y/)  

The data-sets we share on OSF are typically very large (many GBs) so they have been compressed in zipped archives which have been split into volumes. These zipped volumes can be seen as files with file-endings like .zip.001, .zip.002,.zip.003, .zip.004, etc. The easiest way to extract them, I find, is to use the open-source [7zip program](https://www.7-zip.org/), but it may also work using WinZip or the build in Mac/Win compression handlers. In this example I will download the **rat resident intruder videos**, but the same approach is used for downloading any compressed data from the SimBA OSF repository. 

1. Navigate to the rat videos folder on our [OSF repository](https://osf.io/sr3ck/) and you will see something looking like this:

2. Download all the .zip files you can see in the folder and place them together in a folder on your computer. In this example, I would click on each of the six files, and each time click download using the botton around the top right of the screen in the OSF interface that shows up. 



3. Next, navigate to the folder where the downloaded files are stored. If you are using 7zip like me (I recommend it), right click on the first file (.zip.001) and choose to extract this file:

4. That's it! The first compressed file is linked to all the other files in the compressed library, and all of the video files should appear in mp4 format.
