    "### CREATE MULTI-CLASS CLASSIFIERS REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "Some requirements for this to run succesfully (there is currently (10/23) no way of doing this in the GUI):\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1)** All files inside the `project_folder/csv/targets_inserted` directory contains an annotation column which name represent a class of mutually exclusive behaviors and values that map to different types of that behaviour class. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the column may be named \"Running\", and each row contains a value between 0 and 3, where 0 represents \"no running\", 1 represent \"slow speed running\", 2 represents \"medium speed running\", and 3 represents \"fast speed running\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "**(2)** If creating a single classifier, the SimBA project_config.ini needs to contain a map pairing the values in the annotation column to behavior names. In the [SML Setting], insert a `classifier_map_1` option. See [THIS](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/multiclass_project_config.ini) config file as an example. For example, the [SML Settings] may read:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[SML settings]\n",
    "model_dir = /Users/simon/Desktop/envs/troubleshooting/multilabel/models\n",
    "model_path_1 = /Users/simon/Desktop/envs/troubleshooting/multilabel/models/generated_models/syllable_class.sav\n",
    "no_targets = 1\n",
    "target_name_1 = running\n",
    "classifier_map_1 = {0: 'no running', 1: 'slow speed running', 2: 'medium speed running', 3: 'fast speed running'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "**(3)** If creating multiple multi-class classifiers, the SimBA meta files inside the `project_folder/configs` directory needs to contain a map pairing the values in the annotation column to behavior names. This involves inserting a column named `classifier_map` and the map into the first row. See last column in [THIS](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/multiclass_meta.csv) config meta file as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(4)** We can use sampling to balance the class distributions of annoatated frames when creating classifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "* When creating a single classifier: Open the `project_config.ini` in a text editor. Under the [create ensemble settings] section find the [under_sample_setting] section and set this to either `random undersample multiclass frames` or `random undersample multiclass bouts`. Next, under the [create ensemble settings] section and [under_sample_ratio] section, set this to a dictionary that defines a baseline target class, and ratios to sample of the non-target classes relative to the target class. For example, this is a valid entry: {'target_var': 0, 'sampling_ratio': {1: 1.0, 2: 1.0, 3: 1.0}}.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example I: You have 4 classes of behaviors 0 represents \"no running\", 1 represent \"slow speed running\", 2 represents \"medium speed running\", and 3 represents \"fast speed running\". You have 100 annotated frames of no running, 500 annotated frames each of \"slow speed running\", \"medium speed running\", and \"fast speed running\". Now you want to sample as many annotations in each class as in there is in the \"no running class\" for training. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Set the target_var to zero (no running) and the sampling ratios to 1.0 for each of the other classes:  {'target_var': 0, 'sampling_ratio': {1: 1.0, 2: 1.0, 3: 1.0}}. For each of the non-target classes (1, 2, 3), 100% of the count of annotations in the target class (0) will be sampled. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Example II: You have 100 annotated frames of no running, 500 annotated frames each of \"slow speed running\", \"medium speed running\", and \"fast speed running\". Now you want half the numer of annotations present in the non-running class for all the non-target classes. Set the target_var to zero (no running) and the sampling ratios to 0.5 for each of the non-target classes:  {'target_var': 0, 'sampling_ratio': {1: 0.5, 2: 0.5, 3: 0.5}}. For each of the non-target classes (1, 2, 3), 50% of the count of annotations in the target class (0) will be sampled. \n",

    "    Here is example config file undersample setting for a multiclass task:\n",
    "    \n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* When creating multiple classifiers: Open the files in the `project_folder/configs` directory in a text editor. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Under the ``under_sample_setting`` header insert either``random undersample multiclass frames`` or ``random undersample multiclass bouts``. Under the ``under_sample_ratio`` header, insert your sampling ratios e.g., `{'target_var': 0, 'sampling_ratio': {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}}`. \n",
