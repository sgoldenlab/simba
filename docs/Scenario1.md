# SimBA Tutorial:

To faciliate the initial use of SimBA, we provide several use scenarios. We have created these scenarios around a hypothetical experiment that take a user from initial use (completely new start) all the way through analyzing a complete experiment and then adding additional experimental datasets to an initial project.

All scenarios assume that the videos have been [pre-processed](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/tutorial_process_videos.md) and that DeepLabCut CSV pose-estimation tracking files have been created.

# **Hypothetical data set**:
Three days of resident-intruder testing between aggressive CD-1 mice and subordinante C57 intruders. Each day of testing has 10 pairs of mice, for a total of 30 videos recorded across 3 days. Recordings are 3 minutes in duration, in color, at 30fps.

Also, so that we do not overfit the predictive classifiers to the experimental data, a different set of pilot videos have been recorded of resident-inturder pairings using identical video acquisition parameters. A total of 20 pilot videos were recorded.

# **Scenario 1**: From scratch...
In this series of Scenarios, you have the above pilot videos and DLC tracking data, the experimental videos and DLC tracking data, and SimBA. All videos have been pre-processed and DLC tracked. You now would like to generate a new predictive classifier for "Behavior that Will Get a Nature Paper (Behavior BtWGaNP)". In this first Scenario, we will use the pilot data to generate the classifier for behavior BtWGaNP. In later scenario tutorials, we will use this predictive classifier to classify BtWGaNP behaviours for Day 1 of the experiment ([Scenario 2](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario2.md), add behavioural data with the goal of improving the behavioral classifier ([Scenario 3](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario3.md), and use the predictive classifier to classify behaviour BtWGaNP for Day 2 of the experiment ([Scenario 4](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario4.md)). 

### Pipeline breakdown:
For processing datasets, the pipeline is split into a few sections. These sections are listed below along with their corresponding functions:

## Part 1: Create a new project
This section describes how to create a new project for behavioral classifier predictions.

![](/images/createproject2.PNG "createproject2")

### Step 1: Generate Project Config

In this step you create your main project folder, which will then auto-populate with all the required sub-directories.

1. In the main SimBA window, click on `File` and and `Create a new project`. The following windows will pop up.

![](/images/Create_project_1.PNG "createproject")

2. Navigate to the `[ Generate project config ]` tab. Under **General Settings**, specify a `Project Path` which is the directory that will contain your main project folder.

3. `Project Name` is the name of your project. 
*Keep in mind that the project name cannot contain spaces. We suggest to instead use underscore "_"* 

4. In the `SML Settings` sub-menu, put in the number of predictive classifiers that you wish to create. For an example, in Scenario 1 we would like to create a single classifier. We will enter the number 1. Note that in the real world you would probably want to create multiple classifiers concurrently as this would decrease the number of times a video would need to be manually annotated. For simplicity, we will here create a single classifier. *Note: If you are using SimBA only for region of intrest (ROI) analysis, and do not wish to create any classifiers, enter `1` in this entry box.*

5. Click <img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/addclassifier.PNG" width="153" height="27" /> a single time, and it creates a row as shown in the following image. In each entry box, fill in the name of the behavior (BtWGaNP) that you want to classify. If you click too many times, as long as you leave the extra boxes empty, all is well. *Note: If you are using SimBA only for region of intrest (ROI) analysis, and do not wish to create any classifiers, enter any name in the the single entry box.*


<p align="center">
  <img width="385" height="106" src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/classifier1.PNG">
</p>

6. The sub-menu `Animal Settings - # config` is used to specify the number of animals and body parts that that the pose estimation tracking data contains. The default for **SimBA** is 2 animals and 16 body parts (`2 animals, 16bp`). There are a few other - **yet not validaded** - options, accessible in the dropdown menu. This selection is the annotation configuration you should have previously used when labelling images in DeepLabCut or DeepPoseKit - see the tutorial for **[Pose estimation body-part labelling](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Tutorial_DLC.md#pose-estimation-body-part-labelling)** for more information.

The second drop-down in the `Animal Settings` menu is the `Type of Tracking` menu. In the current scenario we will leave this at the default `Classical tracking`. `Classical tracking` is used when your videos contain one animal, or two animals that are clearly (by eye) discriminable, such as a white and a black coated animal. A second option in the `Type of Tracking` dropdown menu is `Multi tracking`. Select the `Multi tracking` option from the `Type of Tracking` dropdown menu *only when* the animals in your protocol are not discriminabl by eye and you have used newer pose-estimation tools to perform your animal tracking. These newer tools include multi-animal DeepLabCut [DLC version >=2.2b5](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/releases/tag/v2.2b5) and [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/). In this tutorial we will use `Classical tracking`. If you have multi-animal tracking data from [DeepLabCut >=2.2b5](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/releases/tag/v2.2b5) or [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/), then head over to the seperate tutorial on *Import multi-animal data* to learn how to import this data into SimBA. Come back to this tutorial after you have completed the *Import multi-animal data* tutorial and your multi-animal data has been imported into SimBA. 

*>Note:* If you want to use a different body-part configuration that is not shown in the drop-down menu - go tho the tutorial for creating [user-defined pose-configurations](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/simba_JJ_branch/docs/Pose_config.md) in SimBA. 

7. Click on `Generate Project Config` to generate your project. The project folder will be located in the specified `Project Path`. The Project will remain open, and the main console will report that the project has been created.

### Step 2: Import videos into project folder

In general, you can choose to import either one or multiple videos. The imported videos are used for visualizing predictions, standardizing distances across videos by calculating metric distances from pixel distances, and annotating behaviours for supervised machine learning classifiers.  

In this current Scenario 1, we now want to import the 20 pilot videos that we will use to train the classifier for Behavior BtWGaNP. 

>*Note*: There are several considerations when selecting the number of videos for training classifers. Most importantly, the number of videos is not as important as the total number of behavioral events present within the videos. Using something that is frequent, such as attacks, may only require a handfull of videos; using something that is less frrequent, such as lateral threat displays, will require more videos for the same number of events. Further, the expression of these behaviors should be representative of the overall experimental data (i.e., attack behaviors exhibited should generalize to how attacks normally look, and not only be extremely robust or extemely weak). Lastly, you need enough videos that some can be left over to validate the generated predicitive classifiers against. We do not want to test the classifiers on videos that have been used to generate the classifiers. **Here we import 20 videos, having identified that 19 videos contain enough events of Behavior BtWGaNP to get an acceptable sample, and that the remaining video will be used for validation**. As a sanity check, we can also create rendered visualizations of the data that is processed in the subsequent days and phases of Scenarios [2-4](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/tree/master/docs). We will also evaluate the accuracy of the predictive classifier using various [evaluation tools](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-7-train-machine-model) built into SimBA. 

![](/images/Import_videos.PNG "Import_videos")

#### To import multiple videos
1. Navigate to the `[ Import videos into project folder ]` tab.
2. Under the `Import multiple videos` heading, click on `Browse Folder` to select a folder that contains **all the pilot videos** to import into your project.
3. Enter the file type of your videos. (e.g., *mp4*, *avi*, *mov*, etc) in the `Video type` entry box.
4. Click on `Import multiple videos`. 

>*Note*: If you have a lot of videos, or exceptionally high resolution/frame rate/duration videos, it might take a few minutes before all the videos are imported. The main SimBA terminal window will report when the process is complete. If your videos are very large and you are conscious about disk space, try ticking the `Import SYMLINKS` checkbutton. This will import soft links (shortcuts) to the videos rather then actual videos (hard copies).  

### Step 3: Import DLC Tracking Data
In this step, you will import your pose-estimation tracking data from DeepLabCut in CSV file format. For the pilot videos, this means that you should have 20 individual CSV files corresponding to each of the individual videos.

>*Note*: DLC outputs CSV files with exceptionally long file names. We have included a function that will automatically copy the DLC CSV files, remove the excess DLC notations from the filename, and paste the new CSV files within the SimBA project. The new CSV will now have the same name as the corresponding video. The original DLC output CSV will still be present in its original folder.

![](/images/Import_data_create_project_new_1.png "importcsv")

#### To import multiple DLC csv files

1. Navigate to the `[ Import tracking data ]` tab. The first dropdown menu specify your file-type. In this tutorial we are importing CSV files from DLC and we will leave this at the default (**CSV (DLC/DeepPoseKit)**). If you have pose-estimation data in alternative file-formats, for example from multi-animal DLC or SLEAP, then please see the seperate [SimBA  multi-animal tutorial](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Multi_animal_pose.md) for how to import this data. 

2. Under the `Interpolate missing pose-estimation data` heading, select how SimBA should handle missing animals in your pose-estimation input files. For best classifier performance, it is important that the animals are present in all the videos throughout the recording. We recommend that you use the [SimBA video clipping tools](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Tutorial_tools.md#shorten-videos) to remove time-segments of the video where the animals are absent from the recorded arena. However - if clipping the videos is not an option - then we can tell SimBA to interpolate the missing values. 

You can tell SimBA to *only* interpolate frames where entire animals are missing (the `Animal(s): Nearest`, `Animals(s): Linear` and `Animal(s) Quadratic` options in the dropdown menu shown below) or you can tell SimBA to interpolate every occurance of a missing body-part (the `Body-parts: Nearest`, `Body-parts: Linear` and `Body-parts: Quadratic` options in the dropdown menu shown below). For both option, SimBA offers three methods of interpolation - linear, nearest, and quadratic. Figures that show the differences between interpolation methods can be found [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Interpolation_comparison.png) or [HERE](https://gist.github.com/gyassine/b47b90e8de935cc06ef856401f7582b0).

![](/images/Interpolation_0821_3.png "importcsv")

>*Note*: We recommend that you make sure that the animals are not absent from the video recording and that you pre-process the videos by removing video segments where the animals are not present, before performing pose-estimation and importing the data into SimBA. Interpolations will result in feeding inaccurate data into SimBA and should be avoided where possible.

3. Occasionally, the data coming out of pose-estimation packages is “jittery”, and body-part predictions show small, but unrealistic, “jumps” between sequential frames. “Smoothing” is an optional pre-processing step where the pose-estimation predictions, in any given frame, are averaged with the predictions in the preceding and proceeding frames. This pre-processing step can serve to generate more realistic and truthful tracking predictions. For a *before-and-after* video example of expected output of “smoothing”, check out [THIS VIDEO](https://youtu.be/d9-Bi4_HyfQ).

SimBA allows the option to smooth the post-estimation data using a [Gaussian](https://towardsdatascience.com/gaussian-smoothing-in-time-series-data-c6801f8a4dc) or a [Savitzky Golay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_filter) kernel when importing the data. To perform Gaussian smoothing, select `Gaussian` in the “Smoothing data” dropdown menu. To perform Savitzky-Golay smoothing, select `Savitzky Golay` in the “Smoothing data” dropdown menu. Once selected in the dropdown, an entry box titled `Time window (ms)` will be displayed next to the drop-down menu, like in the image below. In this entry box, we specify a time window in milliseconds (e.g., 200). This time window will be used by SimBA in the background to identify the preceding and proceeding frames, the pose-estimation predictions in those frames, and how much influence those predictions should have when correcting the current prediction. If you are unsure what value to use, I recommend to begin with a value somewhere between `100-300`. In this tutorial we will skip smoothing of your pose-estimation data, and select `None` in the `Smoothing` drop-down menu. 

>*Note*: After performing `interpolation` and/or `smoothing`, we may want to visualize the results before proceeding with the rest of the analysis pipeline; to confirm the interpolation and/or smoothing improves the pose-estimation tracking. To visualize the results, I recommend to use the [Visualize pose estimation in folder](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Tutorial_tools.md#visualize-pose-estimation-in-folder) function that can be accessed throught the [Tools](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Tutorial_tools.md#visualize-pose-estimation-in-folder) menu in the main SimBA terminal. 

![](/images/new_smooth.png "importcsv")

4. Under the `Import multiple csv files` heading, click on `Browse Folder` to select the folder that contains the CSV files that you wish to import into your project. Click on `Import csv to project folder`. 

>*Note*: SimBA also provides the ability to import single videos and their corressponding CSV files. For more information, click [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#part-1-create-a-new-project-1). This method is not used in Scenario 1.

### Step 4: Extract frames into project folder
This step will extract all the frames from every pilot video that is imported into the project following [**Step 2**](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-2-import-videos-into-project-folder). The frames are used for behavioral labeling when creating classifiers.

>*Note*: Splitting videos up into frames can take time if you have a lot of high resolution videos at high frame rates. The frames can also take up a lot of hard drive space. This is a good point to grab a coffee, or perhaps the latest edition of Machine Intelligence Daily. Once the step is completed, close the `Project Configuration` window. The main console will remain open and report when the process is complete. 

![](/images/extractframeintop.PNG "extractframeintop")

## Part 2: Load project
In Part 1, we created a project. To continue working with this project, we **must** load it. This section describes how to load and work with SimBA projects.

### Step 1: Load Project Config
In this step you will load the *project_config.ini* file that was created.
> *Note:* A project_config.ini should **always** be loaded before any other process.

1. In the main SimBA window, click on `File` and `Load project`. The following windows will pop up.

![](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Load_project_SimBA.PNG "importdlc")

2. Click on `Browse File`. Then, navigate to the directory that you created your project in and click on your *project folder*. Locate the *project_config.ini* file and select it. Once this step is completed, the `File Selected` entry box should look like the following, and you should no longer see the text *No file selected*:

![](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Load_project2_SimBA.PNG "importdlc")

In this image, you can see the `Desktop` is my selected working directory, `tutorial` is my project name, and the last two sections of the folder path is always going to be `project_folder/project_config.ini`.

### Step 2 (Optional step) : Import more DLC Tracking Data or videos

In this step, you can choose to import more pose estimation data and/or more videos. You can only archive analysed files, define new classifiers, and remove previously defined classifiers.  If this isn't relevant then you can skip this step. This is however relevant for [Scenario 4](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario4.md#part-2-load-the-project-and-import-your-new-data) and you can read more about these options in the [Scenario 4 tutorial](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario4.md#part-2-load-the-project-and-import-your-new-data). However, this is not relevant for the current Scenaro 1, so please skip to Step 3 (but remain aware you can do this if needed later).

![](/images/Create_project_3.PNG "importdlc")

1. Click on the `[ Further imports (data/video/frames) ]` tab. From here you can import more data or videos into the project folder. The imported .csv files will be placed in the `project_folder/csv/input` directory, and the imported videos will be placed in the `project_folder/videos` directory. 

2. Once the videos are imported, you can extract frames from the additional videos by clicking on `Extract frames` under the **Extract further frames into project folder** heading. 

3. If you already have existing frames of the videos in the project folder, you can import the folder that contains the frames into the project. Under the **Import frame folders** heading, click on `Browse Folder` to choose the folder thar contains the frames, and click on `Import frames`. The frames will be imported into the `project_folder/frames/input` folder. 

4. If you would like to *add* a new classifier to the current project, type the name of the new classifier in the `Classifier` entry box in the `Add new classifier(s)` sub-menu. 

5. If you would like to *remove* a previously defined classifier from the current project, click on `Choose a classifier to remove` in the `Remove existing classifiers(s)` submenu. Once clicked, a window will appear with a dropdown menu where you select the classifier you wish to remove from the current project. 

6. Once you have analyzed your videos, and/or used videos to create classifiers in SimBA  (see [Scenario 4](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario4.md#part-2-load-the-project-and-import-your-new-data)), you may want to archive your analyzed files to prevent them from being analyzed by SimBA again. Use the `Archive processed files` menu to enter a folder name for your analyzed files and click on `Archive` to move your analyzed files into this folder. 

### Step 3: Set video parameters
In this step, you can customize the meta parameters for each of your videos (fps, resolution, metric distances) and provide additional custom video information (Animal ID, group etc). This can be very helpful when analyzing data later on. Are there any groups, conditions, days, treatments, etc, that will make your analysis easier? Note that if youd like to change any of these parameters, you can do so with the SimBA [video pre-processing tools](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/tutorial_process_videos.md). Note that the video pre-processing should be performed prior to analyzing the videos through DeepLabCut, SLEAP, or DeepPoseKit. 

Importantly, in these menues, you also set the **pixels per millimeter** for all of your videos. You will be using a tool that requires the known distance between two points (e.g., the cage width or the cage height) in order to calculate **pixels per millimeter**. We calculate this measure in each video so that we can standardize variables in metric units, and no longer become bound by working with pixel location data. This means that it does not matter if your camera moved slighly across different video recording sessions. 

1. Under **Set video parameters (distances,resolution,etc.)**, the entry box named `Distance in mm` is the known distance between two points in the videos in **millimeters**. If the known distance is the same in all the videos in the project, then enter the millimeter value *(e.g,: 245)* and click on `Auto populate Distance in mm in tables`. This will auto-populate the table in the next step (see below). If you leave the `Distance in mm` entry box empty, the known distance will default to zero and you will fill in the value for each video individually. 

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/setvidparameter.PNG" width="391" height="96" />

2. Click on `Set Video Parameters` and the following windows will pop up.

![](/images/videoinfo_table_20vid.PNG "videoinfo_table_20vid.PNG")

3. In the above example we imported the 20 pilot videos and their names are listed the left most `Video` column. SimbA auto-populated the known distance to 245 millimeter in the previous step, and this is now displayed in the `Distance in mm` column. 

4. You can click on the values in the entry boxes and change them until you are satisfied. By default, the entry boxes are populated with the meta data from the video files. 

5. Regardless if you updated the values in the table or not, click on `Update distance_in_mm` at the top of the window: this will save the information displayed in the table into a CSV file. The CSV file is saved as *video_info.csv* and is stored in the `project_folder\logs` folder. After clicking on the `Update distance_in_mm` button, you can proceed to the next step. 

6. Next, to get the `Pixels/mm` for the first video, click on `Video1` and the following window will pop up. The window that pops up displays the first frame of `Video1`.

>*Note*: When the frame is displayed, it may not be shown at the correct aspect ratio. To fix this, drag the window corner to the correct aspect ratio. 

<p align="center">
  <img width="300" height="400" src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/getcoord1.PNG">
</p>

7. Now, double **left** click to select two points that defines the known distance in real life. In this case, we know that the two **pink connected dots** represent a distance of 245 millimeter in real life.
<p align="center">
  <img width="300" height="400" src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/getcoord2.PNG">
</p>

8. If you misplaced one or both of the dots, you can double click on either of the dots to place them somewhere else in the image. Once you are done, hit `Esc`.

<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="500" src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/getcoord.gif">
</p>

9. If every step is done correctly, the `Pixels/mm` column in the table should populate with the number of pixels that represent one millimeter, 
<p align="center">
  <img width="700" height="350" src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/videoinfo_table2.PNG">
</p>

10. Repeat the steps for every video in the table, and once it is done, click on `Save Data`. This will update the CSV file named **video_info.csv** in `/project_folder/log` directory that contains your video meta data. 

> *Note:* If you have a a very large amount of videos then this process (Step 10 above) can become time-consuming. If you are confident that your camera moved **minimally** across recordings, and that the `Pixels/mm` therefore is near-identical across videos, then SimBA has the option of applying the `Pixels/mm` created for the first video in the table, on all other videos in the table. To proceed with this, click on the red `Duplicate index 1 pixel/mm (CAUTION!)` button. 

![](/images/Create_project_4.PNG "project4_dup.PNG")

11. You can also chose to add further columns to the meta data file (e.g., AnimalID or experimental group) by clicking on the `Add Column` button. This information will be saved in additional columns to your **video_info.csv** file.

### Step 4: Outlier Correction

Outlier correction is used to correct gross tracking inaccuracies by detecting outliers based on movements and locations of body parts in relation to the animal body length. For more details, click [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/Outlier_settings.pdf). The annotation options are based upon the yaml.config settings, and we suggest that defaults be kept. The only values that must be manually entered in the Settings menu are the *Location Criterion* and the *Movement Criterion*, explained below.

<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/outliercorrection.PNG" width="156" height="109" />

1. Click on `Settings` and the following window will pop up.

<p align="center">
  <img width="300" height="400" src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/outliercorrection2.PNG">
</p>

2. Select the body parts for Animal 1 and Animal 2 that you want to use to calculate a reference value. The reference value will be the mean or median Euclidian distance in millimeters between the two body parts of the two animals in all frames. Again, we suggest you keep the default settings.

3. Enter values for the `Movement criterion` and the `Location criterion`. 

- `Movement criterion`. A body part coordinate will be flagged and corrected as a "movement outlier" if the body part moves the *reference value multiplied by the criterion value* across two sequential frames. The reference value is the mean or median length of the animal between the selected two body parts. The criteron value is a multiplier of the reference value. For example, the distance between Nose_1 and Tail_base_1 is 100mm and the movement criterion is 0.5, any body part that moves 50mm across two sequential frames will be corrected. **We suggest a movement criterion value between 0.7 to 1.5**.

- `Location criterion`. A body part coordinate will be flagged and correct as a "location outlier" if the distance between the body part and at least two other body parts belonging to the same animal are longer than the *reference value multiplied by the criterion value* within a single frame. The reference value is the mean or median length of the animal between the selected two body parts. The criteron value is a multiplier of the reference value. For example, the distance between Nose_1 and Tail_base_1 is 100mm and the location criterion is 1.5, any body part located greater than 150 mm from two other body parts will be corrected. **We suggest a location criterion value of 1.5 or greater**.

>*Note:* Movement outliers are corrected prior to location outliers. Specifically, (i) movement outliers are first corrected, and (ii) location outliers are then corrected on the dataframe that contains the movement corrected data. That means that there is likely to be *fewer* location outliers than movement outliers corrected.   

Body parts flagged as movement or location outliers will be re-placed in their last reliable coordinate. 

4. Chose to calculate the *median or mean* Euclidian distance in millimeters between the two body parts at the bottom of the `Settings` window and click on `Confirm Config`. 

5. Click to run the outlier correction. You can follow the progress in the main SimBA window. Once complete, two new CSV log files will appear in the `/project_folder/log` folder. These two files contain the number of body parts corrected following the two outlier correction methods for each video in the project. The files will look similar to the worksheets in [this Microsoft Excel file](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/Outlier_corrections.xlsx). 

> *Note:* In some scenarios, SimBA users are confident that the pose-estimation is perfected, no gross innacuracies are present, and the user may want to completely skip the use of SimBAs outlier correction tools. To do this, click on the red `Skip outlier correction (CAUTION)` button. Clicking on this button will format your CSV files and make them compatible with subsequent procedures (see below) without removing any outliers from you tracking data. 

>*Note:* Some users are are primarily intrested in using SimBA for other things than predictive classification. This may include using SimBA for analyzing animal movements, the animals directionality or "gaze", animal velocities / distance travelled, or time spent / entries made into user-defined regions of interest. If you are inrested in using these functions in SimBA, you now have all the data you need and do not need to proceed with the current tutorial. Instead, head to the [SimBA ROI tutorial](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial.md).          

### Step 5: Extract Features
Based on the coordinates of body parts in each frame - and the frame rate and the pixels per millimeter values - the feature extraction step calculates a larger set of features used for behavioral classification. Features are values such as metric distances between body parts, angles, areas, movement, paths, and their deviations and rank in individual frames and across rolling windows. This feature set extracted from the tracking data is what we are going to use to predict behavior BtWGaNP, using the relationships between features, rather than the pose estimation data itself. 

This set of features will depend on the body-parts tracked during pose-estimation (which is defined when creating the project). Click [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/Feature_description.csv) for an example list of features when tracking 2 mice and 16 body parts. Click [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/features_user_defined_pose_config.csv) for an example set of features when using a user-defined body-part configuration.

>*Note I*: Some users of SimBA have their own third-party python feature extraction class, and want to use that class within the SimBA GUi environment. This may be helful when there is a specific set of features, not calculated in the SimBA default feature extraction code, that will be helpful for downstream ML algorithms. To learn how to use third-party feature extraction classes in SimBA, click [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/extractFeatures.md). 

>*Note II*: Some users may want to take advantage of a sub-set of the feature extraction method in SimBA, and use that output data within their own third-party applications outside of the SimBA environment. E.g., users may just want to calculate angles, movements and/or sizes of the animals and save that data in CSV format. To learn how to do this in SimBA, click [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/feature_subsets.md). 

1. Click on the tab `Extract Features`, and then the button `Extract Features`. 

![](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Extract_features_SimBA.PNG "extract_features")

New CSV files, that contain the feature data and the pose-estimation data, will be generated and saved in the `project_folder\csv\features_extracted` directory, with one file for every DLC tracking file imported to the project. This tab also displays a second button - `Append ROI data to features`. We explain the function of this button in the [ROI tutorial](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/simba_JJ_branch/docs/ROI_tutorial.md), and how it can be used to create features from spatial locations/objects in the videos.  

2. We want to validate the classifier for behavior BtWGaNP on a separate video, and that video should not be used in the training and testing steps. In the current Scenario 1, we have generated 20 files containing features and they are stored in the `project_folder\csv\features_extracted` folder. To store away one of these files for later validation, navigate to the `project_folder\csv\features_extracted` folder, and cut one file out of the `project_folder\csv\features_extracted` folder, and paste it somewhere else outside of your `project_folder`. This way, SimBA won't see the file in later steps, and it will be omitted from inclusion for when creating the model. We will later define the directory path to this file, and try to predict behavior BtWGaNP in this file from the classifer generated using data in the other 19 data files.  

### Step 6: Label Behavior (i.e, create annotations for predictive classifiers)
This step is used to label the behaviors in each frames of a video. This data will be concatenated with the extracted features and used for the creating behavioral classifier. 

>*Note:* SimBA performs similar functions such as the open-source JWatcher or commercial Noldus Observer systems, with the exception that SimBA automates the backend integration of behavioral annotation with creating predictive classifiers. If you already have such annotations stored in alterantive file formats, like JWatcher or Noldus Observer, they can be appended directly to the tracking data and no behavioral annotations needs to be done in SimBA. For example, the [CRIM13](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Video_Datasets/CRIM13/CRIM13/Main.html) dataset was annotated using ['Piotr’s Matlab Toolbox'](https://pdollar.github.io/toolbox/) and we appended these annotations to the tracking data using a version of [this script](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/Caltech_2_DLC.py). 

If you already have annotation videos created with these alternative tools, or any other behavioral annotator, and would like to use them to create predictive classifiers, please let us know as we would like to write scripts that could process these data for SimBA. If you have created such scripts yourself, please consider contributing them to the community!

**Important**: The behavioral labelling is a critical step. A computer will only learn what you teach it, so if your annotations are not correct then the classifiers will fail. **SimBA uses every single frame**, and therefore the "start" and "stop" frames for a given behavior are very important. Please take the time to create clear and well-defined operationalized definitions of the complete behavior, including start and stop frames. As an example, here are machine learning operationalized definitions of [mouse](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/Operational_definitions_mouse_resident_intruder.pdf) and [rat](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/Operational_definitions_rat_resident_intruder.pdf) predictive classifiers for aggressive behaviors in resident-intruder protocols.

1. Click on the `Label Behavior` tab in the `Load Project` window and you should see the following menu:

<p align="center">
  <img width="720" height="720" src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/Label_behavior.png">
</p>

Use the first button (i) in the image above if you are starting to create behavior labels for a video from scratch. Use the second button (ii) to continue annotating a video that you have made behavior labels for previously in the current project. In the third menu (iii) we have button-click access to functions that append behavior labels generated in third-party apps to your SimBA dataset. To read more about how to append annotations created in third-party applications, click [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/third_party_annot.md).

1. In the current scenario, we want to click on the first button - `Select video (create new video annotation)`. In your project folder, navigate to the `/project_folder/videos` folder and select the video file (e.g., mp4 or avi file) representing the video you wish to annotate. 

<p align="center">
  <img width="800" height="720" src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/labelbe.PNG">
</p>

2. Please click [here](/docs/labelling_aggression_tutorial.md) to learn how to use the behavior annotation interface.

3. Once finished, click on `Generate/Save` and it will generate a new CSV file in *project_folder/csv/targets_inserted* folder. Repeat this step for all the files you wish you use to generate the predictive classifier for behavior BtWGaNP.

>*Note:* If you used SimBAs behavior label annotation interface to create behavior labels for the first half of your video, and now you want create labels for the second half of a video, then you can do so by clicking on the second button in the `Label Behavior` menu titled `Select video (Continue with existing video annotation)`. After clicking on this button, follow the same steps as when creating a new annotations. The difference with clicking on this button will be that when the SimBA behavior label interface shows up, it will show up from the last saved frame with your previous annotations for this file in memory. 
  

### Step 7: Train Machine Model
This step is used for training new machine models for behavioral classifications in SimBA. There are a range of machine learning settings (called hyper-parameters) data sampling method, and evaluation settings, that influence the performance of the classifiers and how it is interpreted. We have currated a list of parameters and sampling methods that can be tweaked and validated. For more technical explanations, see the [scikit-learn RandomRandomForestClassifier API](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) or join the discussion on our [Gitter page](https://gitter.im/SimBA-Resource/community). 

To facilitate use and make this step as painless as possible, users can import hyper-parameters, sampling and evaluations setting from pre-packaged CSV files (SEE BELOW). This may be a lot to look at, so please read this whole section before starting to build your own classifiers.

> **Note**: SimBA allows you to generate predictive classifiers in two different *modes*. You can either **(i)** specify a single set of hyperparameters, and train a single predictive classifiers using that defined set of hyperparameters. Alternatively, you can **(ii)** specify many different Hyperparameter settings, and batch train multiple different models, each using a different set of Hyperparameters. The second option is relevant for the current Scenario. For example, here we may want to generate five different classifiers that all predict the behavior BtWGaNP. We want to evaluate each one, and proceed to the Experimental data with the classifier that best captures behavior BtWGaNP in the pilot data and validation video. Thus, the first section of this part of the tutorial describes the different Hyperparameter settings, and what you can do to avoid setting them manually (*HINT*: you can load them all from a *metadata* file at the top of the window), while the second part of the tutorial section describes how to proceed with either of the two *modes* for generating classifiers.       

#### Train predictive classifier(s): settings

Click on `SETTINGS` in the [TRAIN MACHINE MODEL] tab and the following, slightly indimidating (but I promise: easy to use!) window will pop up. We will go over the meaning of each of the settings in turn. 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/machine_model_settings_2023_01.png" />
</p>

**1. LOAD META DATA**. If you have a CSV file containing hyperparameter metadata, you can import this file by clicking on `Browse File` and then click on `Load`. This will autofill all the Hyperparameter entry boxes and model evaluation settings. For the Scenario 1, we [provide](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/BtWGaNP_meta.csv) a Metadata file that will populate the Hyperparameter entry boxes and evaluation settings with some default values. Please save this file to disk and load it. If you downloaded SimBA through our github page, the Metadata file should be in the *simba/misc* directory. Alternatively, there is an up-to-date meta file[HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/meta_data_2023.csv) which covers additional newer settings recently included in SimBA (including class weights ans shapley values).


**2. MACHINE MODEL ALGORITHM**. Choose a machine model algorithm to use from the drop down menu: `RF` ,`GBC`,`Xboost`. For this scenario, we will choose RF (*Note:*: GBC and XGBoost options are still under development). 

**3. BEHAVIOR**. Use the drop-down menu to select the behavioral classifier you wish to define the hyper-parameters for. In this Scenario, only one *BEHAVIOR* should be seen in the drop-down menu (BtWGaNP). If you are generating multiple classifiers, they should all be seen in the drop-down menu. 

**4. RANDOM FOREST ESTIMATORS**. The number of decision trees we should use in our classifier. Typically a value between 100-2000. In most instances, a higher value won't hurt you. If you have a large dataset and are seeing `MemoryError` while building the classifier, then try to decrease the number of estimators. 

**5. MAX FEATURES**. Number of features to consider when looking for the best split. Select `sqrt` from the dropdown to use the square root of the total number of features in your dataset when evaluating a split. Select `log` from the dropdown to use the log of the total number of features in your dataset when evaluating a split. Select None from the dropdown to use all of the features in your dataset when evaluating a split. 

**6. CRITERION**. Select the metric used to measure the quality of each split (*gini* or *entropy*). 

**7. TEST SIZE**. Select the ratio of your data that should be used to test your model. For example, selecting `0.2` from the drop-down will results in the model beeing trained on 80% of your data, and tested on 20% of your data.

**8. TRAIN TEST SPLIT TYPE**. Select how you want to sample annotated frames for training and testing data-sets. If you select **FRAMES**, then randomly selected frames will be assigned to the training and testing datasets. Although such a random selection can create accurate classifiers, the performance metric may be inflated due to time-series information *leakage* between the training and test-sets. For more information, see [HERE](https://towardsdatascience.com/avoiding-data-leakage-in-timeseries-101-25ea13fcb15f). To decrease the potential of such leakage, select **BOUTS** from the `Train-Test Split Type` drop-down menu. If you select **BOUTS**, then none of the annotated frames in the classifier training set will come from the same annotated behavior bout as in the classifier testing set. We encurage users to [validate their classifiers](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#critical-validation-step-before-running-machine-model-on-new-data) outside of classifier training before proceeding. See the below image for an illustration of using **FRAMES** vs **BOUTS** Train-Test Split Types:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/bout_vs_frames_split.png" />
</p>


**9. MINIMUM SAMPLE LEAF**. The minimum number of samples required to be a leaf node (e.g., *1*, or increase this value to [prevent over-fitting](https://elitedatascience.com/overfitting-in-machine-learning)).

**10. UNDER-SAMPLE SETTING**. `random undersample` or `None`. If `random undersample`, a random sample of the majority class annotations (usually behavior absent) will be used in the training set. The size of this sample will be taken as a ratio of the minority class (usually behavior present) and the ratio is specified in the `under-sample ratio` box (see below). For more information, click [HERE](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.under_sampling.RandomUnderSampler.html) or [HERE](https://machinelearningmastery.com/random-oversampling-and-undersampling-for-imbalanced-classification/). This setting address issues that arise from "imbalanced" data sets, where the behavior that is predicted is sparse. **Note:** *Class* means the classification that a video frame belongs to. In this Scenario it is either (i) Not BtWGaNP, or (ii) BtWGaNP. The majority class is the class of frames that contains the most examples, which - most certaily - in any use case of SimBA, will be *Not BtWGaNP*. Conversely, the minority class is the class of frames that contains the least examples, which will be *BtWGaNP*. 

> Note: If your behavior is sparse (say you have annotated the behavior to be present in 1-10% of the total number of frames), see if you can improve your classifier by setting the `UNDER-SAMPLE SETTING` to `random undersample` and the `under-sample ratio` to `1`. 

**11. UNDER-SAMPLE RATIO**. The ratio of behavior-absent annotation to behavior-present annotation to use in the training set. For example, if set to `1.0`, an equal number of behavior-present and behavior-absent annotated frames will be used for training. If set to `2.0`, twice as many behavior-absent annotatations than behavior-present annotations will be used for training. If set to `0.5`, twice as many behavior-present annotatations than behavior-absent annotations will be used for training. 

**12. OVER SAMPLE SETTING**. `SMOTE`, `SMOTEEN` or `None`. If "SMOTE" or "SMOTEEN", synthetic data will be generated in the minority class based on k-mean distances in order to balance the two classes. See the imblearn API for details on [SMOTE](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE.html) and [SMOTEEN](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.combine.SMOTEENN.html). 

**13. OVER SAMPLE RATIO**.  The desired ratio of the number of samples in the minority class over the number of samples in the majority class after over synthetic sampling. For example, if `1.0`, N number of synthetic behavior-present annotations will be created so the total count of behavior-present (synthetic and real) equals the total count of behavior-absent annotated frames. 

**14. CLASS WEIGHT SETTINGS**. Although `random undersampling` discussed in point `9` above can produce accurate classifiers, it has a major drawback. When performing undersampling we basically chuck out a bunch of data from the minority class. Instead, we may want to keep **all** the data, but value accurate observations of the minority class equally to the observations in the majority class by assigning weights to the different classes. To do this, select [`balanced`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) or [`balanced_subsample`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) in the `class weight settings` dropdown. 

You can also assign your own weights to the two different classes of observations (behavior-present versus behavior-absent) by selecting the `custom` option in the `class weight settings` dropdown. For example, setting behavior PRESENT to `2`, and behavior ABSENT to `1` will lead the classifier to attribute twice the importance to behavior present annotatons over behavior absent annotations.

</p>

**15. CREATE MODEL META DATA FILE**. Creates a CSV file listing the hyper-parameter settings used when creating the classifier. The generated meta file can be used to create further models by importing it in the `LOAD SETTINGS` menu (see **Step 1** above).

**16. CREATE Example Decision Tree - graphviz**. Saves a visualization of a random decision tree in PDF and .DOT formats. Requires [graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/). For more information on this visualization, click [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.export_graphviz.html). For information on how to install on Windows, click [here](https://bobswift.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GVIZ/pages/20971549/How+to+install+Graphviz+software). For an example of a graphviz decision tree visualization generated through SimBA, click [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/BtWGaNP_tree.pdf). *Note:*  The trees can be very large depending on the Hyperparameter settings. Rather than using a dedicated PDF viewer, try opening the generated PDF by dragging it into a web browser to get a better view. 

**17. Fancy Example Decision Tree - dtreeviz**. Saves a nice looking visualization of a random decision tree in SVG format. Requires [dtreeviz](https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz). For an example of a dtreeviz decision tree visualization generated through SimBA, click [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/dtreeviz_SimBA.png). *Note:* These SVG example decision trees are very large. To be able to view them on standard computers, SimBA limits the depth of the example tree to 3 levels.

**18. Create Classification Report**. Saves a classification report truth table in PNG format displaying precision, recall, f1, and support values. For more information, click [here](http://www.scikit-yb.org/zh/latest/api/classifier/classification_report.html). For an example of a classification report generated through SimBA, click [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/BtWGaNP_classificationReport.png).  

**19. Create Features Importance Bar Graph**. Creates a CSV file that lists the importance's [(gini importances)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_importances.html). For an example of a feature importance list generated through SimBA, click [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/BtWGaNP_feature_importance_log.csv). Also creates a bar chart depecting the top N features features in the classifier. For an example of a bar chart depicting the top *N* features generated through SimBA, click [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/BtWGaNP_feature_bars.png) *Note:* Although [gini importances](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_importances.html) gives an indication of the most important features for predicting the behavior, there are known [flaws when assessing well correlated features](https://explained.ai/rf-importance/). As SimBA uses a very large set of well correlated features to enable flexible usage, consider evaluating features through permutation importance calculatations instead or shapley values (see below). 

**20. # Features**. The number of top N features to plot in the `Create Features Importance Bar Graph`.

**21. Compute Feature Permutation Importances**: Creates a CSV file listing the importance's (permutation importance's) of all features for the classifier. For more details, please click [here](https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blackbox/permutation_importance.html)). Note that calculating permutation importance's is computationally expensive and takes a long time. For an example CSV file that list featue permutation importances, click [here] (https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/BtWGaNP_prediction_permutations_importances.csv). 

**22. Create Learning Curves**: Creates a CSV file listing the f1 score at different test data sizes. For more details on learning curves, please click [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_learning_curve.html)). For more information on the f1 performance score, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score). The learning curve is useful for estimating the benefit of annotating further data. For an example CSV file of the learning curve generated through SimBA, click [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/BtWGaNP_prediction_learning_curve.csv).  

**23. Learning Curve Shuffle K Splits**: Number of cross validations applied at each test data size in the learning curve. 

**24. Learning Curve shuffle Data Splits**: Number of test data sizes in the learning curve.

**25. Create Precision Recall Curves**: Creates a CSV file listing precision at different recall values. This is useful for titration of the false positive vs. false negative classifications of the models by manipulating the `Discrimination threshold` (see below). For an example CSV file of of a precision-recall curve generated through SimBA, click [here](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/BtWGaNP_prediction_precision_recall.csv). This may be informative if your aiming to titrate your classifier to (i) predict all occurances of behavior BtWGaNP, and can live with a few false-positive classifications, or (ii) conversely, you want all predictions of behavior BtWGaNP to be accurate, and can live with a few false-negative classifications, or (iii) you are aiming for a balance between false-negative and false-positive classifications. 

**26. Calculate SHAP scores**: Creates a CSV file listing the contribution of each individual feature to the classification probability of each frame. For more information, see the [SimBA SHAP tutorial](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/edit/master/docs/SHAP.md) and the [SHAP GitHub repository](https://github.com/slundberg/shap). SHAP calculations are an computationally expensive process, so we most likely need to take a smaller random subset of our video frames, and calculate SHAP scores for this random subset. 

**27 # target present**: The number of frames (integer - e.g., `100`) with the behavioral target **present** (with the behavioral target being the behavior selected in the **Behavior** drop-down menu in Step 3 above) to calculate SHAP values for. 

**28 # target absent**: The number of frames (integer - e.g., `100`) with the behavioral target **absent** (with the behavioral target being the behavior selected in the **Behavior** drop-down menu in Step 3 above) to calculate SHAP values for.

- **ADDITIONAL SEETTINGS NOT YET DOCUMENTED ABOVE**:

(i) **SHAP save cadence** SHAP calculations are an computationally expensive, and calculating SHAP values on larger datasets come with long run-times. As a safety pre-caution, you can intermittently save your SHAP values to disk. For example, if you want to save your data every 100 frames, set this value to a 100. If you want to save the data only when all SHAP calculations are complete, then select `ALL FRAMES` from the `SHAP save cadence` dropdown menu.  

(ii) **SHAP multiprocessing** As SHAP calculations are computationally expensive, we can choose to perform these calculations using *multiprocessing*. This means that the data will be split up into as many chunks as there are CPU cores available on your machine, and then processed in parallel. For example, if you have 7 CPU cores on your computer, it will go 7x faster when SHAP multiprocessing is set to **True** relative to when it it set to **False**. Note: if SHAP multiprocessing is set **True**, then the **SHAP save cadence** will be locked to `ALL FRAMES`. The SHAP multiprocessing code is located [HERE](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/81f8e17c254ccb05c48bc5693ab62ecbd8494a14/simba/mixins/train_model_mixin.py#L1531).

(iii) **Calculate partial dependencies** Partial dependencies is another *global explainability* method, that helps you understand the relationship between individual feature values and classification probabilities. For an accessable description of partial dependencies, see [this blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/partial-dependence-plots-with-scikit-learn-966ace4864fc). Ticking this box will calculate partial dependencies for ecery feature in your data set, and one CSV file will be saved for every feature. For an example of this CSV file, click [HERE]. BEWARE: Calculating parial dependencies come with long run-times.

(iv) **Create train/test video and frame index log** When training a model, SimBA takes all your data inside your `project_folder/csv/targets_inserted` directory, and splits it into a _training_ set, and a _testing_ set. How those two sets look like, largely depend on your defined sampling settings above. Let's say we have trained our model, and we want to check which frames, in which videos, was actually used to train and test the model. If this checkbox is ticked, two files will be produced in models folder subdirectories: [train_idx.csv](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/train_idx_example.csv) and [test_idx.csv](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/misc/test_idx_example.csv), that lists the frame numbers from the repective videos that SimBA used in the training and testing of your models(s).

#### Train predictive classifier(s): start the machine training

Once all the entry boxes have been filled in with the desired Hyperparameters and Model Evaluation Settings, the user can either click on `Save settings into global environment` or `Save settings for specific model`. If you click on `Save settings into global environment`, the settings will be saved in to your *project_config.ini* file located in your `project_folder`. These settings can subsequently be retreived and executed to generate a predictive classifier (**Mode 1**). 

However, if you click on `Save settings for specific model`, a config file will be generated in the background (in the `/project_folder/configs` folder) that contains the defined settings. To generate 5 different config files with different settings, for example, simply update the Hyperparameters and Model Evaluation Settings five different times, representing the five different predictive classifiers you want to generate, and after each time you have updated the values, click on `Save settings for specific model` (**Mode 2**). See below for more information.

**(i) Mode 1**: To save the settings into the global environment, and generate a single predictive classifier using these settings, click on `Save settings into global environment`, and then **exit the machine model settings window by closing it**. Next, click on the blue button: `Train single model from global environment`. While the model is training, text is printed in the main SimBA window indicating its progress. A message saying that training is complete will also be printed in the terminal window, together with information on where you can find the generated files.  The model, in *.sav file format*, will be saved in the `project_folder\models\generated_models` folder. If you have chosen to generate model evaluation files, then they will be be saved in the `project_folder\models\generated_models\model_evaluations` folder. 

**(ii) Mode 2**: Alternatively, click on the `Save settings for specific model` button to save the settings for one model. To generate multiple models - for multiple different Hyperparameters used to predict behavior BtWGaNP - redefine the Machine model settings and click on `Save settings for specific model` again. Each time the `Save settings for specific model` is clicked, a new config file is generated in the */project_folder/configs* folder. Next, **exit the machine model settings window by closing it** and click on the *green* button: `Train multiple models, one for each saved setting`. This will generate one model for each of the config files in the */project_folder/configs* folder. The models, in *.sav file format*, will be saved in the `project_folder\models\validations\model_files` folder. Model evaluation files will be saved in the `project_folder\models\validations\model_evaluations` folder. Model meta files, will be saved in the `project_folder\models\validations\meta_data` directory. 

### Step 8. Evaluating the model on new (out-of-sample) data.

If you have chosen to generate classification reports or other metrics of classifier performance, it is worth studying them to ensure that the model(s) performance is acceptable. However, a classifiers performance is perhaps most readily validated by visualizing its predictions and prediction probabilities on a new video, which have not been used for training or testing. This step is critical for (i) visualizing and choosing the ideal classification probability thresholds which captures all of your BtWGaNP behaviors (for more information on what classification threshold is - see Step 4 below), and (i) visual confirmation that model performance is sufficent for running it on experimental data.

You can validate each model *(saved in SAV format)* file. This should be done in a "gold-standard" video that has been fully manually annotated for your behavior of interest, but has not been included in the training dataset. If you followed the tutorial, you may remember that we stored away one CSV file away in a safe place earlier, a [file which we had extracted the features](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-5-extract-features) for but we did not use this file for training or testing of the classifier. Now is the time to use this file. 

In this validation step the user specifies the path to a previously created model in SAV file format, and the path to a CSV file [that contain the features extracted from a video (Step 5 above)](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-5-extract-features). The first process will run the predictions on the video, and visualize the probabilities in a user-interactable line chart, that together with a user-interactable visualization of the video can be used to gauge the ideal discrimination threshold. The second process will create a video with the predictions overlaid together with a gantt plot showing predicted behavioral bouts. Click [here](https://youtu.be/UOLSj7DGKRo) for an expected output validation video for predicting the behavior *copulation*. 

This process allows you to rapidly access the results of the Hyperparameters you have selected on a "gold-standard" behavioral video. If the predictions are not good, you can go back to tweak the appropriate parameters without first running through numerous other videos or adding and/or refining your annotations.

In this step, we will (i) run the classifier on new data, (ii) interactively inspect suitable discrimination thresholds, and (iii) create a video with the predictions overlaid ontop of the new data together with a gantt plot showing predicted behavioral bouts. Click [HERE](https://youtu.be/UOLSj7DGKRo) for an expected validation video. For this, navigate to the [Run machine model] tab and `VALIDATE MODEL ON SINGLE VIDEO menu:

**(1).**  In `SELECT FEATURE DATA FILE`, select the path to a path to a file containing features in the `project_folder/csv/features_extracted` directory created as describes in [STEP 5](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-5-extract-features) above. Note: Make sure this file is **not** a file where the behavior has been labeleld and used to create the classifier you are evaluating.

**(2).** In `SELECT MODEL FILE`, select the path to a path a classifier. In SimBA, classifier are saved in `.sav` file format and typically live in the `model` sub-directories within your SimBA project. 

**(3).** To run the model selected in step 2 on the feature data selected in step 1, click the `RUN` button. In the background, SimBA will generate a behavior probability score for each of the frames in the data and store it in the `project_folder/csv/validation` directory of your SimBA project. 

**(4).** Next, we want to interactively inspect the prediction probabilities of each frame and view them alongside the video. We do this to try an discern a prediction probability demarcation point where the model reliably splits behavior from non-behavior frames. In other words, we determine how sure the model has to be that a behavior occurs on a frame for it to classify a behavior to occur in a frame. To do this, click the `INTERACTIVE PROBABILITY PLOT` button.

In the left window in the example above, you can see the video of the analyzed file. Similar to the [annotation interface](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/label_behavior.md), you can you the buttons to jump forwards and backwards between frames. Some keyboard shortcuts are showed on the right. There is also a button named `SHOW HIGHEST PROBABILITY FRAME`. Clicking on this button will show you the frame with the highest behavioral classification probability. 

In the right window we see the frame number on the x-axis and the classification probability on the y-axis. Clicking on any frame in the graph will display the associated video frame in the left window. The frame number, and the classification probability of the frame, is shown in the graph title. We look at the graph and determine a suitable behavioral probability threshold (the y-axis in the right graph) that separetes the non-behavior from the behavior frames. 

**(5).** Once we have decided on the probability threshold, we fill this value into the `DISCRIMINATION THRESHOLD (0.00-1.0):` entry box. For example, if set to 0.50, then all frames with a probability of containing the behavior of 0.5 or above will be classified as containing the behavior. For further information on classification theshold, click [here](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/api/classifier/threshold.html). In this Scenario. Go ahead and enter the classification threshold identified in the previous Steps.

**(6).** We can also set a `MINIMUM BOUT LENGTH (MS)` criterion. This value represents the minimum length of a classified behavioral bout. **Example**: The random forest makes the following predictions for behavior BtWGaNP over 9 consecutive frames in a 50 fps video: 1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1. This would mean, if we don't have a minimum bout length, that the animals enganged in behavior BtWGaNP for 80ms (4 frames), took a break for 20ms (1 frame), then again enganged in behavior BtWGaNP for another 80ms (4 frames). You may want to classify this as a single 180ms behavior BtWGaNP bout, rather than two separate 80ms BtWGaNP bouts. If the minimum behavior bout length is set to 20, any interruption in the behavior that is 20ms or shorter will be removed and the example behavioral sequence above will be re-classified as: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 - and instead classified as a single 180ms BtWGaNP bout. 

**(7).** Next we want to go ahead and create a validation video and we click on `CREATE VALIDATION VIDEO` and the following pop-up should be shown which gives user controls how the video is created. If you want to use the deafult parameters, just go ahead and click `RUN`.

- If you want SimBA to try to autompute the appropriate font sizes etc., keep the `AUTO COMPUTE STYLES` checked. Otherwise, un-check this box and fill in try out your own values. 

- `TRACKING OPTIONS`: Choose if you want to display the pose-estimation body-part locations and/or the animal names in the validation video.

-  `MULTI-PROCESSING SETTINGS`: Creating videos can be computationally costly, and creating many, long, videos can come with unacceptable run-times. We can solve this using multiprocessing over multiple cores on your computer. To use multi-processing, tick the Multiprocess videos (faster) checkbox. Once ticked, the CPU cores dropdown becomes enabled. This dropdown contains values between 2 and the number of cores available on your computer, with fancier computers having higher CPU counts. In this dropdown, select the number of cores you want to use to create your video. SimBA will create a snippet of video on each core, and then jopin them together to a single video. 

-  `GANTT SETTINGS`: If you select  `Gantt chart: video` or `Gantt chart: final frame only (slightly faster)` in the `Create Gantt plot` drop-down menu, SimBA will create a validation video with an appended Gantt chart plot (see the final gif image in this tutorial below for an example). Creating Gantt charts take longer, and we suggest selecting `None` in the `Create Gantt plot` drop-down menu unles syou use multi-processing.

**(8).** Click the `RUN` button. You can follow the progress in the main operating system terminal. Once complete, you should see a video file representing the analyzed file inside the `project_folder/frames/output/validation` directory.

>*Note I*: SimBA does offer a further form of [`classifier validation` visualization tool](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/classifier_validation.md). This further tool was designed to visualize the possible presence and extent of false-positives classifications. The tool displays the bouts classified as containing the target behavior, with a printed overlay displaying the total number of frames contained each bout, the frames conatined within the bout, and the probability that each specific bout contains the behavior. For more infomration on the `Classifier Validation` tool, see the tutoral on the [Post-classification Validation (detecting false-positives)](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/classifier_validation.md). 

Congrats! You have now generated RF models that can be run on new, experimental data, and we hope those models are doing a good job at recognizing the behaviors of intrest. Proceed to [Scenario 2](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/edit/master/docs/Scenario2.md) to use the BtWGaNP classifier to evaluate new experimental data. If you already have further data that has been processed (outliers are corrected, and the featureshave been calculated), and you now want to run the classifier on this data, proceed to [Scenario 2 - Part 3: Run the classifier on new data](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario2.md#part-3-run-the-classifier-on-new-data).
