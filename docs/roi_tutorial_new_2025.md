</p>

The SimBA region of interest (ROI) interface allows users to draw ROIs on videos. ROI data can be used to calculate basic descriptive 
statistics based on animals movements and locations such as:

* How much time the animals have spent in different ROIs.
* How many times the animals have entered different ROIs.
* The movement distances / velocity animals have in the different ROIs.
* Movement entries / kinematics outside of defined ROIs.
* Calculate how many times and for how long animals have engaged in different classified behaviors inside and outside each ROI.
etc....

Moreover, the ROI data can  be used to build potentially valuable, additional, features for random forest predictive classifiers. Such features can be used to generate a machine model that classify behaviors that depend on the spatial location of body parts in relation to the ROIs. 

> [!CAUTION]
> If spatial locations are irrelevant for the behaviour being classified, then such features should *not* be included in the machine model generation as they just 
> only introduce noise.

# Before analyzing ROIs in SimBA

To analyze ROI data in SimBA (for descriptive statistics, machine learning features, or both descriptive statistics and 
machine learning features) the tracking data **first** has to be processed the **up-to and including the 
*Outlier correction* step described in [Part 2 - Step 4 - Correcting outliers](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-4-outlier-correction)**. 
Thus, before proceeding to calculate ROI based measures, you should have one CSV file for each of the videos in your 
project located within the `project_folder\csv\outlier_corrected_movement_location` sub-directory of your SimBA project.

Specifically, for working with ROIs in SimBA, begin by 
(i) [Importing your videos to your project](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-2-import-videos-into-project-folder), 
(ii) [Import the tracking data and relevant videos to your project](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-3-import-dlc-tracking-data), 
(iii) [Set the video parameters](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-3-set-video-parameters), 
and lastly (iv) [Correct outliers](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Scenario1.md#step-4-outlier-correction) (or click to indicate that you want to *Skip outlier correction* as detailed in the Correct outliers tutorial)

> [!NOTE]
>**A short explanation on what is meant by 
> "using ROI data as features for random forest classifiers"** When ROIs have been drawn in SimBA, 
> then we can calculate several metrics that goes beyond the coordinates of the different body-parts from pose-estimation. 
> For example - for each frame of the video - we can calculate the distance between the different body-parts and the different ROIs, 
> or if the animal is inside or outside the ROIs. In some instances (depending on which body parts are tracked), we can also calculate if the animal is 
> [directing towards the ROIs](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial.md#part-3-generating-features-from-roi-data)
> (see below for more information). These measures can be used to calculate several further features such as the percentage of the session, 
> up to and including the any frame, the animal has spent within a specific ROI. These and other ROI-based features could be useful additions 
> for classifying behaviors in certain scenarios.

# Defining ROIs in SimBA

1. In the main SimBA console window, begin loading your project by clicking on `File` and `Load project`. In the **[Load Project]** tab, click on `Browse File` and select the `project_config.ini` that belongs to your project. 

2. Navigate to the **ROI** tab, which should look like the image below (we will be using the menu highted by the red rectangle and red arrow):

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/roi_tutorial/roi_tutorial_1.webp" />
</p>

> [!NOTE]
> If you have ROIs on some or all the videos in your project, and want to delete your ROI work and start from scratch, use the `Delete all ROIs` button directly below the `Define ROIs` button.
>  More info at [the end](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial_new.md#delete-all-roi-definitions-in-your-simba-project) of this tutorial.  

3. Next, we click on the `Define ROIs` button, and the following table will pop open.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/roi_tutorial/roi_tutorial_2.webp" height="600"/>
</p>

This table contain one row for each of the videos in the project (each video inside the `project_folder/videos directory in the SImBA procet). Each video in the project has three buttons associated with it: **Draw, Reset,** and **Apply to all**. 
The functions associated with each button is described in detail below. But in brief:

* The <kbd>**Draw**</kbd> button allows you to start to draw ROI shapes on the specific video. If drawings already exist for the specific video, then the <kbd>**Draw**</kbd> buttons opens an interface where you can move, re-define, or add ROI shapes onto the video.  

* The <kbd>**Reset**</kbd> button deletes any ROIs made on the specific video and allows you to restart the ROI drawings from scratch by next clicking on the <kbd>**Draw**</kbd> button. 

* The <kbd>**Apply to all**</kbd> buttons copies the ROI drawing made on the specific video and replicates them on all other videos in the project. If a drawing has been applied to all videos videos in the project by clicking on the <kbd>**Apply to all**</kbd> button, then the shapes for any specific video can be moved or re-defined (and new ROI shapes can be added) by clicking on the <kbd>**Draw**</kbd> button.

4. To begin to draw your ROI shapes, click on the <kbd>**Draw**</kbd> button for the first video in the table. Once clicked, two windows will pop up that look like this:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/roi_tutorial/roi_tutorial_3.webp"/>
</p>

The right window (titled **Define shape**) will display the first frame of the video. The left window (titled **REGION OF INTEREST (ROI) SETTINGS**) will contain information, buttons and entry-boxes for creating and manpulating your ROI shapes, and we will go through each of their function in detail below.  

> [!NOTE]
> The aesthetics of the menus might look slightly different on your computer (this tutorial was written on a Microsoft Windows computer). The functions, however, are the same regardless of operating system.   

# THE **REGION OF INTEREST (ROI) SETTINGS** WINDOW

## VIDEO AND FRAME INFORMATION

The first top part of the **REGION OF INTEREST (ROI) SETTINGS** menu is titled *VIDEO AND FRAME INFORMATION* and is useful for general troubleshooting. This menu displays the name of the current video, the format of the current video, its frame rate, and the frame number and the timestamp of the frame that is being displayed in the right **Define shape** window. 

## CHANGE IMAGE

Occationally, the very first frame of the video isn't suitable for defining your ROIs and you'd like to use a different frame while drawing. Alternatively, you might want to check how your ROIs look in a different frame of the video. To manipulate the frame being displayed in the **Define shape** window, use the buttons in the **CHANGE IMAGE** menus (see the video below): 

* Click on `+1s` to display a frame one second *later* in the video relative to the frame currently being displayed.

* Click on `-1s` to display a frame one second *earlier* in the video relative to the frame currently displayed. 

* If you need move a custom distance forward or backwards in the video, then enter the number of seconds you want to move forward or backward in the `CUSTOM SECONDS` entry box, and either click on the <kbd>FORWARD</kbd> or <kbd>REVERSE</kbd> buttons.
 
* If you want to display the first frame of the video, click on the <kbd>FIRST FRAME</kbd>. If you want to display the last frame of the video, click on the <kbd>LAST FRAME</kbd>.

[roi_tutorial_4.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e448bb20-95ec-4504-a52d-9ec588b040bd)

## SET NEW SHAPE

In the  next menu, titles **SET NEW SHAPE**, we define which shape type we want to draw. SimBA supports three shape types - rectangles, circles, and polygon. Select the shape type you want to draw by clicking the appropriate button. The selected ROI shape type will be highlighted in red font.

## SHAPE ATTRIBUTES
Next, once you have selected the `Shape type`, you can pick a few of its attributes (or go ahead with the default values). Users drawing ROIs in SimBA are often working in a wide variety of video and monitor resolutions and are sometimes drawing relatively complex geometries involving many shapes. The options in this menu can help you keep shapes visible, distinguable and aligned while drawing. SimBA allowes the user to set three different *shape attributes*:

* **Shape thickness**: This dropdown menu controls the thickness of the lines in the ROIs (see the top of the image below). If you select a higher value in the `Shape thickness` dropdown menu, then the lines of your ROI will be thicker. 
  
* **Ear tag size**: Each shape that you draw will have *ear tags* (more info below). These tags can be clicked on to move shapes, align shapes, or manipulate the dimensions of the shapes. In this dropdown menu, select the size that the ear-tags of your ROI should have (see the bottom of the image below). If you select a higher value in the `Ear tag size` dropdown, then the ear-tags of the ROI will be bigger. 
  
* **Shape color**: Each shape that you draw will have a color. From the dropdown, select the color that your ROI should have.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to change these shape attributes later, after completing your drawing, you can - more info below):

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/roi_new_2.png" />
</p>

## SHAPE NAME
Each shape in SimBA has to have a unique name. This name cannot be shared with another ROI name for the same video. In the `SHAPE NAME` entry box, enter the name of your shape as a string (e.g., `bottom left corner`, or `center` etc..). 
  
## DRAW
Once you have defined your shape, it is time to draw it. The methods for drawing the three different shape types (`Rectangle`, `Circle` and `Polygon`) is slightly different from each other and detailed below. However, regardless of the shape type you are currently drawing, begin by clicking on <kbd>DRAW</kbd> button.
  
### DRAW RECTANGLE
To draw a rectangle, click and hold the left mouse button at the top left corner of your rectangle and drag the mouse to the bottom right corner of the rectangle. If you're unhappy with your rectangle, you can start to draw the rectangle again by holding the left mouse button at the top left corner of your, new, revised, rectangle. The previous rectangle will be automatically discarded. When you are happy with your rectangle, **press the keyboard `ESCAPE` key**  OR **click the left mouse button anywhere in the ROI SETTINGS window** to save your rectangle to memory. 

[draw_rectangle.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2dbec23-e652-4e1e-809d-fe070dd24d02)

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to modify the appearance, location, or size, width, height of your rectangle, you can do this later - see the `CHANGE ROI SIZES` or `CHANGE ROI ATTRIBUTES` sections below. 

### DRAW CIRCLE
Begin by **clicking and holding down** the left mouse button at the center of the circle. Next, drag the mouse, **while holding down the left mouse button**, towards the outer bounds of the circle. Once the circle looks good, **let go of the left mouse button**. If you're unhappy with your circle, begin again by **clicking and holding down** the left mouse button at the center of the circle and start dragging the cursor to the outer bounds of the rectangle. Once the circle looks good, hit the **keyboard `ESCAPE` key** OR **click the left mouse button anywhere in the ROI SETTINGS window** and the circle will be saved to memory.

[draw_circle.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/962783ea-8923-414f-8b53-3d462fe1c08b)

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to modify the appearance, location, or radius of your circle, you can do this later - see the `CHANGE ROI SIZES` or `CHANGE ROI ATTRIBUTES` sections below. 

### DRAW POLYGON 
Left mouse click on **at least three different locations** in the image that defines the outer bounds of your polygon. You should see filled circles, representing the polygon vertices, and and lines connecting the vertices, appear where you click. Once you are happy with your polygon, hit the **keyboard `ESCAPE` key** OR 
**click the left mouse button anywhere in the ROI SETTINGS window** and the polygon will appear in full and the polygon will be saved to memory.

[draw_polygon.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/586d08bb-bf9c-4e8c-86b0-c7e46a133237)

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to modify the appearance, location, or size, or positions of the polygon edges, you can do this later - see the `CHANGE ROI SIZES` or `CHANGE ROI ATTRIBUTES` sections below. 

## SHAPE MANIPULATIONS

SimBA allows several forms of shape manipulations that are described in detail below, this includes:

* [Deleting ROIs](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial_new.md#deleting-rois) - allows you to delete all ROIs, or single user-defined ROIs. 

* [Duplicating ROIs](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial_new.md#duplicating-rois) - allows you to duplicate already-drawn ROIs.

* [Change ROI location](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial_new.md#changing-roi-locations) - allows you to move ROIs to different locations. 

* [Change the shape of ROIs](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial_new.md#changing-the-shape-of-the-roi) - allows you to change the width and/or hight of a rectangle, radius of a circle, or the locations of the outer bounds of a polygon.

* [Drawing shapes of fixed metric sizes](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial_new.md#change-roi-attributes) - allows you to change the name, color or other attributes of an already created ROI.
  
### DELETING ROIs

* To delete all drawn ROIs, click the <kbd>DELETE ALL</kbd> button in the `DRAW` sub-menu:
* 
[delete_all.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7cddd4a-2009-4fa5-9b4b-a54dc0bd1783)


* To delete a specific ROI, first use the `ROI` drop-down menu in the `DRAW` sub-menu to select the ROI you wish to delete. Next, click on the <kbd>DELETE SELECTED ROI</kbd> button:

[delete_selected.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bfe62a0-0361-4481-894e-0f2b422f883f)

### DUPLICATE ROIs

1) To duplicate an already-draw ROI, first use the `ROI` drop-down menu in the `DRAW` sub-menu to select the ROI you wish to duplicate. Next, click on the <kbd>DUPLICATE SELECTED ROI</kbd> button. A new ROI, with the same dimensions and attributes as the ROI selected in the `ROI` drop-down menu, should appear in the frame near the original ROI:

[duplicate_rectangle.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e5af366-ec63-434d-a53e-900d8800b4bf)

2. The duplicated ROI will inherit the name of the original ROI with the `_duplicated` suffix appended to the name. Thus, if you look in the `ROI` dropdown menu, you should see a new ROI with a name in this format: `MY_ROI_NAME_duplicated`. To change this name, and/or any other attribute belonging to this ROI, see the [Change ROI attributes](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial_new.md#change-roi-attributes) section below. 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/roi_tutorial/roi_tutorial_5.webp"/>
</p>


### CHANGING ROI LOCATIONS
  
1. To change the location of an ROI, begin by clicking the <kbd>MOVE SHAPE</kbd> button in the `SHAPE INTERACTION` sub-menu to enter into **MOVE MODE**. Once clicked, the "EAR TAGS" of each shape will be displayed in the drawing window. Rectangles will have 9 ear tags, circles have 2 ear-tags, and polygons have as many ear-tags as there are user-defined outer bounds (plus a **center** ear tag). 
  
2. Next, **click and hold the left mouse button** on the **center** ear tag of the ROI that you wish to move. You should see the entire ROI shape changing its color to **grey**, marking that the entire has been selected (if this grey color is unsutable, not to worry, I will show you how to change it later on). 
  
3. Next, **while holding the mouse left button**, drag the mouse cursor to the new location the where you want your ROI to be located. Once in location, **let go of the left mouse button**. You should see your ROI, in its defined color, being displayed in the new location. If you want to change a second ROI location, go ahead and drag the **center** tag for that ROI. 

4. Once the ROIs have been moved into their correct location. We need to exit the **MOVE MODE**. Select the `DEFINE SHAPE` window (e.g., by clicking the top bar), and hit the **keyboard `ESCAPE` key**.

[move_shapes.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e120954-1ca4-4cf4-af97-36a0393b609c)

### CHANGING ROI SHAPES
  
1. To change the shape of an ROI, begin by clicking the <kbd>MOVE SHAPE</kbd> button in the `SHAPE INTERACTION` sub-menu to enter into **MOVE MODE**. Once clicked, the "EAR TAGS" of each shape will be displayed in the drawing window. Rectangles will have 9 ear tags, circles have 2 ear-tags, and polygons have as many ear-tags as there are user-defined outer bounds (plus a **center** ear tag). 
  
2. Next, **click and hold the left mouse button** on the edge ear tag which you want to manipulate. Once you ***click and hold the left mouse button** on the ear-tag, the part of the ROI shape you are manipulating changes its color to grey (if this grey color is unsutable, not to worry, I will show you how to change it later on). Different ROI ear-tags will help you to manipulate different parts of the ROI. For example:
  
    **Rectangles**:
    - Clicking and holding the left middle ear-tag of a rectangle allows you to control the location of the left border or the rectangle.
  
    - Clicking and holding the top-left corner ear-tag of a rectangle allows you to control the top border and left border of the rectangle.   
  
    - Clicking and holding the bottom middle ear-tag of a rectangle allows you to control the bottom border or the rectangle. 
  
   **Circles**:
    - Clicking and holding the left border ear-tag of a circle allows you to control the radius of the circle. 
  
   **Circles**:
    - Clicking and holding the outer bounds of the polygon allows you to control the location of the outer bound in the polygon (i.e., control the two lines connected to the clicked-on ear-tag).
  
3. Next, after selecting an ear-tag, **while holding the mouse left button**, drag the mouse cursor to the new location the where you want the edge you are manipulating to be located. Once the edge is in the location you want, **let go of the left mouse button**, and the new ROI shape should be displayed.

4. Finally, once the ROIs have been moved into their correct location. We need to exit the **MOVE MODE**. Select the `DEFINE SHAPE` window (e.g., by clicking the top bar), and hit the **keyboard `ESCAPE` key**.

[change_shapes.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f4ebcf6-b343-4c52-9779-42d84e11bee5)

   
### CHANGE ROI ATTRIBUTES

1. To change the attributes of an already-created ROI, click on the <kbd>CHANGE ROI</kbd> button and a pop-up menu will appear. This pop-up menu has a drop-down menu, titled `CHANGE ROI`, which allows you to select the ROI that you want to change.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/roi_tutorial/change_roi_popup.webp"/>
</p>

2. To change the name of the ROI, enter a new name in the `NEW SHAPE NAME` entry box. TO change the color, thickness, or ear-tag size of the shape, use the respective dropdown windows. Once complete, hit the <kbd>SAVE ATTRIBUTES</kbd> button.

[change_attributes.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0af65571-8c72-4125-aa04-8d9524567dd5)


## SHOW SHAPE SIZE INFORMATION. 

Sometimes we need some metrics representing the sizes of the ROIs we have drawn. We can display this by clicking on the <kbd>SHOW SHAPE INFO</kbd> button located to the right in the `SHAPE INTERACTION` submenu. 

1. By clicking the `Show shape info.` button, some numbers are displayed inside our ROIs:

  (i). One number is displayed inside each of your drawn **rectangles, representing the area cm2 of the rectangle** (based on your pixel per millimeter conversion factor in your `project_folder/logs/video_info.csv`)
  
  (ii) One number is displayed inside each of your drawn **circles, representing the cm radius your circle.** (based on your pixel per millimeter conversion factor in your `project_folder/logs/video_info.csv`)
  
  (iii) One number is displayed inside each of your drawn **polygons, representing the area cm2 of your polygon.** (based on your pixel per millimeter conversion factor in your `project_folder/logs/video_info.csv`)
  
2. When the <kbd>SHOW SHAPE INFO</kbd> button is clicked, the text of the button toggles to <kbd>HIDE SHAPE INFO</kbd>. Click the button again to hide the shape size information. 

[show_shape_size.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fdb61c1-7110-46dc-8845-cd6c47c10cef)


## DRAW SHAPES OF USER-DEFINED METRIC SIZES

To draw shapes of specific metric sizes (i.e., specified size in millimeters), first open the `File (ROI)` drop-down menu at the head of the **REGION OF INTEREST (ROI) SETTINGS** menu and click the `Draw ROIs of pre-defined sizes` option:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/roi_tutorial/fix_metric_size.webp"/>
</p>

Once clicked, you should see the following pop-up opening allowing you to draw a range of different shapes with specified sizes. If you need a shape-type that is missing, consider letting us know through [Gitter](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#SimBA-Resource_community:gitter.im) or by opening en issue on [GithHub](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

![predefined_sizes_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c76037f3-f15c-430f-b552-fd945c15862b)

In the `SETTINGS` frame, fill in the name of your ROI, and choose its color, thickness, and ear tag size. 

#### DRAW A RECTANGLE OF METRIC WIDTH & HEIGHT

To draw a RECTANGLE of set size, fill in its metric width and height in millimeter and click ``ADD RECTANGLE`` as in the video below:

## PREFRENCES

The `File` drop-down in the  **REGION OF INTEREST (ROI) SETTINGS** header also contains a *Preferences* option. Clicking this, will bring-up a pop-up window that allows you to control some aspects of how the SimBA ROI interface behaves. 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/roi_tutorial/preferences_toolbar.webp"/>
</p>

1) **ROI SELECT COLOR**: This controls the color of teh selected edges while in **MOVE MODE** as in the video below. 

2) **DUPLICATION JUMP SIZE**: When ROIs are duplicated, each edge of the duplicated copy are placed, by defaults +20 by +20 pixels from the original ROI. Use this dropdown to select an alternative "*duplication-jump-size*".

3) **LINE TYPE**: Most often you wouldn't need to worry about this. It controls how lines are visualized on the frame through the [OpenCV](https://hawk-tech-blog.com/python-opencv-line-type/) library. In most cases its safe to keep this at `-1`.

## APPLY SHAPES FROM ANOTHER VIDEO

Sometimes we have created ROIs in one video, saved them, and opened up a second video to start drawing new ROIs on this second video. Now we may want to replicate the ROIs on the first video on the second video, and we can do this with the `Apply shapes from another video` sub-menu. 

1. To duplicate the ROI shapes already defined in a different video on the current video, navigate to the `Select video` dropdown menu in the `Apply shapes from another video` menu. This dropdown menu will show the videos in your SimBA project that has defined ROIs. 

2. In this dropdown menu, select the video which has the ROIs you wish to replicate. Once selected, click `Apply`. The ROIs from the video in the `Select video` dropdown menu will appear on the frame.

## DELETE ALL ROI DEFINITIONS IN SIMBA PROJECT

Somtimes we may want to delete all ROI definitions in a SimBA project and start from scratch.

1. To delete all the ROI definitions in the SimBA projects, click on the `Delete all ROI definitions` under the [ROI] tab in the load project menu, and the following menu should pop open:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/ROI_delete.png" />
</p>

2. Click `Yes` to delete all ROI definitions in a SimBA project.

> [!NOTE]
> Your ROIs are saved inside your SImBA project, at the location `project_folder/logs/measures/ROIdefinitions.h5`. To delete the ROIs in the SImBA project, you could also manually delete this file. 

## SAVE ROIs

Once all the ROI drawings on the video looks good. remember to hit the `SAVE` button shown to save your video's ROIs to disk as in the image below. After clicking the save button, you are good to close the ROI **REGION OF INTEREST (ROI) SETTINGS** window and **DEFINE SHAPES** window. 

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/images/roi_tutorial/save_btn.webp"/>
</p>

## STANDARDIZE ROI SIZE ACROSS VIDEOS

There may be situations where you have manually drawn ROIs on a bunch of videos where the camera location has shifted slightly across recordings.
You may also want to ROIs to have the same metric sizes across recordings, but due to this shift in camera locations, some videos may have different 
pixel per millimeter conversion factors. 

In these situations, you may want to "standardize" the ROI metric sizes relative to some baseline measurement. For example, say that this baseline video has a pixel per millimeter of `10`.
Say there are a further two videos in the project with ROIs, and these videos has pixels per millimeter of `9` and `11`. 
At runtime, the area of the rectangles, circles and polygons in the two additional videos get their ROI areas increased/decreased with 10% while the baseline video ROIs are unchanged.
To do this, click the `File` heading in the `PROJECT VIDEOS: ROI TABLE` window. This shows a pop-up with a single dropdown window, as in the screengrabs
below:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/tutorials_rst/img/roi/roi_tutorial_metric.webp"/>
</p>

Select the video that you want to act as the "baseline" reference video which the ROI sizes should be corrected against. Once selected, click the 
<kbd>RUN</kbd> button. All ROIs in the project will be standardized using the ROIs in the baseline video as reference. 

## OVERLAY POSE-ESTIMATION DATA ON ROI TRACKING

To show the tracking (pose) data in the ROI drawing window, click the `File (ROI')` menu button followed bt `Preferences`. Next, toggle the `SHOW TRACKING DATA:` drop-down menu to `True`, as in the video below. 

Alternatively, to romove the tracking data from the drawing window, toggle the `SHOW TRACKING DATA:` drop-down menu to `False`.

[roi_show_pose_fps_15.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e4c04a6-d20b-440b-9606-2f82a328ff8b)


Similarly, to view bounding boxes derived from the pose estimation, or to view both pose-estimation and bounding boxes, select the appropriate option in the dropdown and hit SAVE:

[show_roi_bbox_fps_15.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59d9a751-6b98-425e-8650-22b1a1e9363a)


## OVERLAY GRID LINES ON DRAWING IMAGES

To see grid-lines, click the `File (ROI')` menu button followed bt `Preferences`. Next, toggle the `SHOW GRID LINES:` drop-down menu to to the size (in millimeters) which you want your grid lines, as in the video below. 

Alternatively, to romove the grid lines data from the drawing window, toggle the `SHOW SHOE GRID LINES` drop-down menu to `False`.

[roi_show_gridline.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afaf5d56-665c-440d-8de7-03552e940846)

Similarly, to overlay hexagonal grid lines, which may help you draw straight, toggle the `SHOW HEXAGONAL GRID LINES:` drop-down menu to to the size (in millimeters) which you want your hexagon radii, as in the video below. You can also change their colors if it helps you see better:

[roi_show_gridline_hexagon_fps_15.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bbd93a9-42df-47f0-867c-706de5efa3c7)

## CHANGE DRAWING WINDOW SIZE
If the drawing window is too big (or too small) for your monitor resolution, you can change the maximum and/or minimum percent the drawing window should take up. To make the drawing window larger, increase the values. To make the drawing window smaller, decrease the values:

## NEXT STEPS
Once your ROI definitions are all defined, close the `ROI table`, `Regions of Interest Settings` and `Define Shape` windows and head back to the [ROI] tab in the load project menu. 

* SimBA saves your drawn ROI definitions (the ROI locations, colors, shapes, sizes with their associated video file names etc) in a single compressed `.H5` file in that you can find at `project_folder/logs/measures/ROI_definitions.h5`. If you want to extract this H5 information, to a human-readable CSV format, use [THIS](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/Tutorial_tools.md#extract-roi-definitions-to-human-readable-format) tool. 

* If you want to analyze descriptive statistics of movements in relation to your defined ROIs, use the `Analyze ROI data` button as detailed in `Step 2` in [THIS TUTORIAL](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial.md#part-2-analyzing-roi-data).

* If you want to create machine learning features using your ROI definitions, use the `Append ROI data to features` in the `Extract features` tab as detailed in [THIS TUTORIAL](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial.md#part-3-generating-features-from-roi-data)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is possible to treat all areas **NOT** covered by an ROI drawing as a single additional ROI and compute the chosen metrics for this, single, ROI. For an example of how this works, see [THIS](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/_static/img/outside_roi_example.mp4) visualization, and this [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/issues/453#issuecomment-3114729111) discussion for more information. For more information on how to access this functionality, see [THIS](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial.md#part-2-analyzing-roi-data) toturial for how to compute metrics for the "outside-ROIs" zones, and [THIS](https://github.com/sgoldenlab/simba/blob/master/docs/ROI_tutorial.md#part-4-visualizing-roi-data) tutorial for visualizations of the "outside-ROIs" zones.
