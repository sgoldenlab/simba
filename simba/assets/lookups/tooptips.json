  "bp_config_csv_path": "CSV listing body-part names in the order expected by the model. Each name on its own line (e.g., Nose, LeftEar, ...).",
  "batch_dropdown": "Number of frames processed at once. Larger batches speed up inference but require more GPU RAM.",

  "workers_dropdown": "How many CPU worker threads to use for pre/post-processing. Set <= available cores.",
  "format_dropdown": "Model serialization format (None = auto-detect from file extension). Match the format used when exporting the weights.",

  "interpolate_dropdown": "Fill missing detections by interpolating coordinates over time. Recommended for cleaner trajectories.",
  "stream_dropdown": "Enable streaming inference which reads frames sequentially (lower memory footprint). Disable for random seeking.",
  "threshold_dropdown": "Minimum detection confidence to keep. Lower values detect more poses but introduce more false positives.",
  "iou_dropdown": "Minimum bounding-box overlap required to keep the same track between frames. Higher values demand tighter alignment.",
